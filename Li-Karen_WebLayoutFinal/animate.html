            Animate: Breakfast with Brown Animated
        </h1>
        
        <p>
            For my Animate Final, I chose to animate Brown floating in space with lots of bacon and eggs. It took a lot of time and motion tweens but eventually I got there. It was really cool seeing everything come together one piece at a time! I think it was a more difficult project for me but I enjoyed it.
