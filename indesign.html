            For my Indesign Final, I decided to do a postcard layout. I added some of my digital artwork - the cover and the postcard 'stamps' - which was done prior to taking this class. Putting each page together and working with the master pages was a new concept for me. I'm really happy with this project because I feel like it looks nice and clean.
